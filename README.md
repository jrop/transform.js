# transform.js

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/jrop/transform.js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Transform.js is a gulpfile generator, automatically creating per-file gulp tasks by looking for special comments in source files.

# Installing

```
npm install -g transform.js
```

# Use

Suppose your project tree looks like the following:

```
app/
  public/
    css/main.less # we want to transform this to CSS
    js/
      jquery/     # we don't want to touch this one
      app.js      # we want to transform this with webpack
  server.js       # we want to leave this file untouched
```

In order to generate the gulpfile for this project, we just need to provide content-type 'hints' to transform.js  This is done with the special comment suffix `%` anywhere in the file.  For example, in our LESS file, we would leave a comment like:

```
/*% less */
...your LESS code...
```

This adds the content-type hint `less` to this file.  Transform.js will generate a gulp task equivalent (at least similar) to the following:

```
gulp.task('public/css/main.less', function() {
    let pipe = gulp.src('public/css/main.less')
    pipe = pipe.pipe(YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE.less.call(pipe))
    return pipe
})
```

`YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE` is a module in the file `transform.js` (in the same directory as `gulpfile.js`; it is assumed this file exists) that exports transformations in the form of gulp-streams.

# transform.js file

The `transform.js` file for this example might look like:

```
'use strict'
const less = require('gulp-less')

module.exports.less = function() {
  return this.pipe(less())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('.build'))
}
```

There are a few important things to note:

* the current stream is passed to each transformer through the `this` context
* each transformer name must match the one specified in the content-type hint
* there are a few "magic" transformers that you may define:
  1. `start` - files are piped through this transformer before anything else
  2. `finish` - files are piped through this transformer after all other pipes
  3. `each` - files are piped through this transformer after each named transform
  4. `blank` - any file with no content-type hint specified (say, with an empty content-type hint comment, such as `//%`) is passed through this transformer.  Useful for files which you only want to copy to the output directory.

# Getting Fancy

## Passing Options to Transformers

You may specify arguments to pass to each transformer in your content-type hint comment.  Say I have an example JavaScript file that I want to transform using file-specific options.  The content-type hint might look like:

```
//% babel({
//%   myOption: 'somePreference'
//% })
```

The corresponding transformer in `transform.js` will receive this object in the following way:

```
module.exports.babel = function(opts) {
  // use `opts.myOption`
  return this.pipe(...)
}
```

## Specifying Multiple Transformers

Multiple transformers may be specified in the content-type hint comment as well, using the "pipe" operator `|>`:

```
//% react |> babel
```

This will generate a gulp task equivalent (at least similar to) the following:

```
gulp.task('the-file-name.js', function() {
  return gulp.src('the-file-name.js')
    .pipe(YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE.react())
    .pipe(YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE.babel())
})
```

## Adding your own Gulp tasks

Export a function `tasks(gulp)` from `transform.js`.  For example:

```
// File: transform.js

module.exports.tasks = function(gulp) {
  gulp.task('my-task', function() {
    // ...
  })
}

```

# Generating a gulpfile

You generate a gulpfile with transform.js by typing:

```
tjs > gulpfile.js
```

## Additionally Generated Gulp Tasks

A few other gulp tasks are generated by default:

* `default` - builds all files with a content-type hint comment specified; also tries to return the stream generated by `YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE.default([done_callback])` (if this method exists; this is useful if you want to extend the default task)
* `watch` - watches all files with a content-type hint comment specified
* `clean` - Tries to call `YOUR_TRANSFORM_MODULE.clean(done_callback)`

# How is this intended to be used?

I wrote this utility because I wanted a build system for my projects where I could specify in each file what transformation I wanted it to undergo, and then dump all of the files to an output directory (say, `.build`) that would be ready to deploy in all environments.  Each time I added a new file, I could "register it with the project" by regenerating a new gulpfile, and then restart it with `gulp watch`.

This project is still in very early stages, and I am still developing/stabilizing it.
